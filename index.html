  <h1 class="one">Samurai of Japan</h1>
  <p class="first">The samurai were fearless warriors who made up a class of people in Japan. They wore two swords and an elaborate head-dress.The samurai lived by a set of rules known as bushido, which commanded them to act with loyalty and
    courage. A samurai considered that he had lost honour, he killed himself.
    The samurai were originally the guards of the emperor of Japan. In 1185, the emperor lost power and Japan became a feudal state. The shogun, or most powerful lord, ruled the country.below him were the feudal lords known as daimios, who
    were served by the samurai.</p>

  <h1 class="two">What makes up the Universe?</h1>
  <p class="second">The Universe is made up of thousands of millions of galaxies, large clouds of dust and gas called nebulae, and the space between them.<br>
    No one knows the size of the Universe, although it has been estimated to have a radius of 10,000 million light years. This may not be correct, as it could continue infinitely in all directions. We do know, however, that the galaxies are moving
    away from each other at a very great speeds. This means that the Universe is expanding all the time. Many astronomers believe that the Universe has been expanding since the time it was formed seems to be between ten and twenty thousand million
    years old. </p>

  <h1 class="three">How did man learn to sail?</h1>
  <p class="third">Before man learned to sail he had to discover the principle of flotation and this is probably did by accident. Noticing how fallen pieces of trees floated in rivers and lakes, primitive man experimented by holding onto logs and
    discovered that they could support his weight and remain afloat.But then the need for some form of power to propel his new – found craft resulted in man developing a crude sail – a piece of skin or other natural material, usually square- shaped,
    which he attached to a rough upright pole, and hoisted above his craft. The pole was held in position amidships (in the middle of the boat) by plaited raw hide ropes. It is known that ancient Cretans built boats such as this as early as 3000 BC.

  <h1 class="four">What was a clipper ship?</h1>
  <p class="fourth">This was a nineteenth century wooden sailing vessel built and rigged, or equipped, for speed. With the discovery of steam and its increasing use in shipping by the early 1800s, the position of the sailing ship as a means of
    transporting people and goods across the oceans, was threatened. So the clipper ship was designed as a final attempt to prove the supremacy of sial over steam.However, for about thirty years, from the 1840s to the 1870s these clippers were
    responsible for a glorious period in the history of sail and the sea. They were beautiful, reaching heights of 60 m (200 ft). they were slender, streamlined and yacht- like, having three and sometimes four masts square- rigged, and carried the
    triangular lateen sail fore and aft ( at the bow and stern).</p>

<h1 class="five">What is an Electromagnet?</h1>
<p class="fifth">A compass needle will only point north- south if there are no other magnets near it. If there are, the needle will be attracted towards them and will point in a different direction or be deflected. It was discovered that if a compass
  was held near a wire carrying an electric current, the needle was deflected. But, if the current was switched off the needle swung back and pointed north-south again. This meant that the current was acting like magnet. If some wire is wrapped
  around a magnet and a current passes through the wire, the magnet will become much stronger. This is known as an electromagnet.</p>
